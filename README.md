## Description

My motivation for doing this project was to build upon my knowledge of MySQL to use Sequalize to make and maintain an e-commerce database effectively.
Accessing a database through JavaScript and the backend is essential for any website that needs to reference and analyze a plethora of data.
I feel very accomplished knowing that I can effectively create a complex database with complex associations and connections with different data tables and be able to connect the database to the backend for the front end to access!
